## Nearing the Finish Line!

When I look back on my college career, it both feels like the appropriate amount of time has passed and like no time has passed at all.

I've gotten so used to all the intricacies of it at this point that I'm confident I could keep doing semesters if I wanted to. Unfortunately I can't currently afford graduate school, and am homesick enough that moving back to OKC and findign a job seem like better alternatives

I'm going to miss a lot of it, though. I'll miss my roomate (and best friend), my climbing team friends, and anyone I've met while I was here. I plan to keep in contant though, and hoep sometime in the future I'll be able to visit.

I'm ready for a new chapter though. I'm gearing up for an entry level career (I've worked since I was 14 but I'll consider this my first quote unquote "real" job) and am excited to live on my own for once. I'm not sure if I'll ever feel like an adult but I'll consider these some good baby steps.

**All that's left is to push through and finish strong!**
