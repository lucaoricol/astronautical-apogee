## Carrer Goals!

I decided to major in CIS due to my mild interest in technology, and (at the time, I haven't been much into it as of late) gaming hobby. I wasn't sure what the major would entail, but if I changed my mind about it that wouldn't be too big of an issue.

Retrospectively I'm very glad I decided on the major. My mild interest as grown into one that I actively keep up with and try to learn about on a consistent basis. I'm sure this is a cliche answer, but the speed at which tech develops means that it never gets boring, and how it's grown throughout history is facinating.

Knowing that, it's funny to say I'm pursuing a career in project management of all things. But after taking a few classes related to it I think it suits me. I believe I have a knack for being able to understand and communicate what needs to be done to accomplish a task or solve a problem, as well as what role I serve in a team environment. Of course I won't know until I start working, but the more I study for my certification the more I think this is the right role for me!

**Here's to hope I pass it the first time!**
