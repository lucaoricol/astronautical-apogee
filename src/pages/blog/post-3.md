## Heading Back Home!

I decided (with some influence from a sibling) to move to Durango for college rather than get a degree in OKC. Funnily enough there was an instituion with a similar tuition waiver program, but it was recended the Summer I was supposed to apply. After weighing options and a long talk with my sister, I made the leap and moved away from family.

Again, retrospectively I'm very glad I did. I think that I wouldn't have become as proficient at independency without the lack of my family being nearby. Granted I still called them frequently (everday) but it gave me the confidence to operate on my own for once. I also didn't take my PC (the CPU pins bent somehow and it would cost a lot to replace) and it actually made me attempt to socialize rather than hole up in my dorm. Ultimately everything worked out.

That said, heading back home is going to be really nice. Close proximity to family, seeing local friends again, and frequenting the places I used to will be both nostolgic and comforting.

**Going to my old bouldering gym is something I'm particularly excited about!**
