## The Future!

I try not to speculate, but it can be fun on occasion. Mostly I think about where I'll end up living and how I'll make it my own, as well as some goals that I have.

For one I've always thought about having a garden (whether it be big or small doesn't matter that much to me). Thankfully my mother has a green thumb and will probably be willing to help, and I hope I get to a place where I can grow my own food.

I'd also love to have a pet. I end up scrolling through local shelters just to torture myself, but now that I'm not in campus dorms it could be a reality.

This isn't much of a new goal, but I'd also love to get stronger in my climbing and strength training. I think I might try a hangboarding protocol to get my fingers stronger, and I'll also have access to a really cool set of training boards at the gym I'll go to.

**It looks bright from here!**
