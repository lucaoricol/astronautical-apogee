	<h2>What I'm Working Towards</h2>
	<p>As I'm about to graduate, I'm working towards getting an entry level certification in project management, known as the CAPM</p>
	<p>As of now I'm almost done creating notes and studying through the performance domains outlined on the PMI website that will be on the test, and plan on earning my certification as soon as I move back home in early May</p>
	<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
		<li>I go to college in {identity.currentState}, but I was born (and plan on moving back to) {identity.nextState} once I've graduated in May.</li>
		<li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My skills are:</p>
	<ul>
		{skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
	</ul>
