	<h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>
	<p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>
	<p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
	<p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
		<li>I go to college in {identity.currentState}, but I was born (and plan on moving back to) {identity.nextState} once I've graduated in May.</li>
		<li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
	</ul>
	<p>My skills are:</p>
	<ul>
		{skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
	</ul>
